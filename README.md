# Adventrue Desing Term Project
Using 6 6 6 LED Cude to deliver sensitive information
We use [Immitation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5Aq7cRc-mU) method to make hardware and software programs. The purpose of this project is "delivery of sensor".

## Hardware
We used "UNO-Board microprocessor" and "Ardiono Sensor Kit" for this project. 
#### Kinds of Sensors
Photo Resistor, Ultrasonic Sensor, Pressure Sensor, Sound Sensor and Flow Sensor
#### Materials
Sordering Machine, Iron stick, Cable, LEDS*216, Bread-Board, UNO-Board, 100(Ohm) Resistors*6, Clipper, Sensors and LCD Monitor

## Software
We used "Arduino(cpp) code" to control Cube.
#### Order of Sensors
Photo Resistor: Low Value  => Low level LEDs ON

                High Value => Low to High level LEDs ON

Ultrasonic Sensor: Low Value  => Low Flipflop Frequency

                   High Value => High Flipflop Frequency

Pressure Sensor: Low Value  => Low Intensity of LED

                 High Value => High Intensity of LED
